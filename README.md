### fusebox backend(node)/frontend sample

A fork from https://github.com/vegarringdal/fusebox-front-and-backend

My initial goals are:
   - Improve the documentation
   - Try to make it more beginner friendly
   - Improve the integration with VS Code 

At this stage I have done nothing.

## normal:

```
npm start
```


## debug server

start vscode

In the run bar select `Debug dev server` and start it with F5
```
 npm run debug
```
