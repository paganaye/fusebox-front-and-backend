### fusebox backend(node)/frontend sample

A fork from https://github.com/vegarringdal/fusebox-front-and-backend

My initial goals are:
   - Improve the documentation
   - Try to make it more beginner friendly
   - Improve the integration with VS Code 

At this stage I have done nothing.

## normal:

```
npm start
```


## debug server

```
start vscode `Debug dev server` then run `npm run debug`
```
